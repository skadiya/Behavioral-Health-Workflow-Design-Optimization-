As a project manager collaborating with the clinical team on the AI care coordinator product for Nicotine addiction patients, my task is to design the initial version of the AI care coordinator insomnia module. The patients will have access to the care coordinator via texting and it will function like a chatbot that interacts with the patient, collects patient-reported metrics, and triages messages back to the admin and therapists.
